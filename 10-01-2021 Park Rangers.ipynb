    "You are responsible for setting the ranger schedule at Riddler River National Park. Four rangers are assigned to two locations: the mountain lookout in the north and the lakeside campground in the south. Each assignment lasts one week (Monday through Friday), and every week two rangers should be in the north and two should be in the south.\n",

    "Your task is to set an assignment schedule that lasts a certain number of weeks and then repeats indefinitely.\n",

    "\n",
    "Each ranger should spend as many weeks in the north as they do in the south.\n",
    "Each ranger should spend the same number of weeks paired with each other ranger.\n",
    "All rangers should move the same number of times over the course of the schedule. This includes potentially moving back to their starting assignment after the last week of the schedule.\n",
    "Exactly two rangers should switch locations each week.\n",
