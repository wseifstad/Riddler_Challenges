    "The finals of the sport climbing competition has eight climbers, each of whom compete in three different events: speed climbing, bouldering and lead climbing. Based on their time and performance, each of the eight climbers is given a ranking (first through eighth, with no ties allowed) in each event, as well as a corresponding score (1 through 8, respectively).\n",
    "\n",
    "The three scores each climber earns are then multiplied together to give a final score. For example, a climber who placed second in speed climbing, fifth in bouldering and sixth in lead climbing would receive a score of 2 × 5 × 6, or 60 points. The gold medalist is whoever achieves the lowest final score among the eight finalists.\n",
